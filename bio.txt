This is where I'll put my bio information.
I am a soon to be software developer based in the great northwest Seattle, WA. The ability to create code work is the beautiful piece of the puzzel that helps create the master peice as a whole. I love the process of building on code for the world of technology to expeirence my work. I'm Looking forward to what the world has to offer for striving software developers like me. 
Software developing has alwyas been an interest of mine when I was young and wanted to know more about how gaming consoles worked. Whether it was old consoles, new consoles, and handheld devices I wanted to know more about the internal work such as how the visuals are being created, processing speeds, and gaming engines. The Year Up program has provdided me the oppertunity to explore my interest and to maximize my skills in coding to help me get where I want to go. 
When not working, I like to go on my computer and open FL Studios to work on producing music whether that's working on a solo project from the ground up or collaborating with an artist. All codes are my own and hope you enjoy my work.
